## ABOUT BOARD GAMES!

The Board Games segment is projected to reach US$3.45bn in 2022. It is a great hobby that combines teamwork and creative thinking.
New games come out all the time and hobbyists are always avid to look for new releases and adding them to their collection. Sometimes it's hard to keep up with knowing how many games you have and what's popular right now in the Board Game community.

With that in mind, we developed SHELFIE.

## What is SHELFIE?
SHELFIE is a tool that allows you to keep track of your Board Game collection, while also showing you the new releases and the most popular games.

By using your camera, you can take a photo of your Board Game shelf - or better yet, a SHELFIE - to have all of those games added to your collection.
